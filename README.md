# AllerScan

# System Requirements

This repository contains all scripts used to analyze the AllerScan sequencing data described in Monaco et al. Profiling Serum Antibodies with a Pan Allergen Phage Library Identifies Key Wheat Allergy Epitopes. All scripts are coded in R 3.6.1 in OSX. To run all enclosed scripts the following libraries are required: RColorBrewer, tidyverse, fpc, data.table, knitr, rafalib, dplyr, gplots, pheatmap,viridis, ggpubr, tidyverse, magrittr, cluster, cowplot, NbClust, clValid, ggfortify, clustree, dendextend, factoextra, FactoMineR, corrplot, GGally, ggiraphExtra, knitr, kableExtra, igraph, vipor, ggbeeswarm, plotly.

# Installation Guide

Installation of all library packages can take between 15 minutes to an hour to complete. All custom code does not require an installation and can be immediately run in native R after acquistion of the AllerScan data set.

# Demo
All custom code specifically processes the AllerScan sequence data described in Monaco et al. Profiling Serum Antibodies with a Pan Allergen Phage Library Identifies Key Wheat Allergy Epitopes. Each script is designed to reproduce on the figures present in the manuscript and take between 1 - 5 minutes to run. Each scrit should exactly reproduce a plot in aforementioned manuscript.

# Instructions for use

All custom code enclosed requires the processed AllerScan sequencing data (which has been compressed into an Rdata object. Upon acquistion of the sequencing data (contact hlarman1@jhmi.edu for access), all scripts can be run as is locally in R/RStudio. All scripts should return the figures presented in the AllerScan manuscript.
